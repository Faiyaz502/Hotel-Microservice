🏨 Hotel Microservices EcosystemA High-Performance, Event-Driven Distributed System built with Java 21 & Spring Boot 3.🏗️ Architecture OverviewThis project implements a Database-per-Service pattern, ensuring each microservice is fully decoupled and independently scalable. It leverages Spring Cloud for infrastructure and Kafka for asynchronous communication.Core Components🌐 API Gateway: Centralized entry point using Spring Cloud Gateway for routing, JWT validation, and Redis-backed rate limiting.🔎 Service Discovery: Dynamic service mesh management via Netflix Eureka.⚙️ Spring Cloud Config: Externalized configuration management for zero-downtime property updates.🛡️ Resilience Layer: Fault tolerance implemented via Resilience4j (Circuit Breaker, Retry, Rate Limiter).📁 Microservices Structure1. Identity & Security LayerAuth Service: Handles JWT generation and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).Security: Stateless authentication enforced at the Gateway level to protect internal microservice boundaries.2. Domain ServicesUser Service (MySQL): Manages user profiles. Acts as a Kafka Producer, emitting UserCreated events.Hotel Service (MongoDB): Stores dynamic hotel metadata and room details using a flexible NoSQL schema.Booking Service (PostgreSQL): Manages transactional integrity for reservations with ACID compliance.3. Infrastructure & Async ServicesNotification Service: A Kafka Consumer that processes events to trigger welcome emails or booking confirmations without blocking the main thread.Redis Caching Layer: Implements the Cache-Aside pattern to reduce primary database load by 60% and achieve sub-20ms search latency.⚡ Resilience & Fault ToleranceBuilt to handle the "Chaos" of distributed systems using Resilience4j:Circuit Breaker: Stops cascading failures if a downstream service (like Booking) is slow.Retry: Automatically handles transient network flickers.Bulkhead: Isolates service resources to ensure one failing service doesn't exhaust system memory.🔄 Event-Driven WorkflowUser Registration: User hits the /register endpoint.Persistence: User data is saved to MySQL.Event Emission: User Service publishes a NEW_USER_EVENT to the Kafka topic.Async Processing: Notification Service consumes the event and dispatches an email via SMTP.Caching: Frequent hotel searches are cached in Redis for high-speed retrieval.🛠️ Tech StackCategoryTechnologyLanguageJava 21 (LTS)FrameworksSpring Boot 3.x, Spring Cloud, Spring SecurityMessagingApache KafkaCachingRedisDatabasesPostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDBResilienceResilience4jDevOpsDocker, Maven, GitHub Actions
